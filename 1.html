    <strong>Create a <u>Table View</u></strong>
    <p>In this lesson, you create a second, table view-based scene, that lists the user’s meals. This meal list becomes the initial scene for your app. You also design custom table cells to display each meal.
    So far, the FoodTracker app has a single scene, that is, a single screen of content. In a storyboard, each scene contains views managed by that a view controller, and any items added to the controller or its views (for example, Auto Layout constraints). A view is a rectangular region that can draw its own content and respond to user events. Views are instances of the UIView class or one of its subclasses. In this case, the scene contains the view controller’s content view, and all of the subviews you added in Interface Builder (the stack view, label, text field, image view, and rating control).</p>

    <p>Now it’s time to create another scene that shows the entire list of meals. Fortunately, iOS comes with a built-in class, UITableView, designed specifically to display a scrolling list of items. A table view is managed by a table view controller (UITableViewController). UITableViewController is a subclass of UIViewController, which is designed to handle table view-related logic. You’ll create the new scene using a table view controller. The controller displays and manages a table view. In fact, the table view is the controller’s content view, and fills the entire space available to the scene.
